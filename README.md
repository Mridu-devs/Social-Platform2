Introduction:

The project is a React.js application built using functional components. It incorporates a user registration and login system, where new users are required to sign up and only existing users can log in. The sign-up process includes validations for various fields such as Name, Phone Number, Email ID, Address, Password, and Confirm Password, ensuring that the user provides valid and complete information.

Once logged in, users can access their profile section. Within this section, they can view their personal details and have the ability to edit their profile information. Additionally, users can create posts containing only text, which can be posted from the profile section.

The application also features a home section where users can view their own posts as well as posts from other users. Each post is displayed along with the profile picture and name of the user who made the post, as well as the date and time it was posted.

To enhance the user experience, a creative navbar has been implemented. The navbar includes emojis that represent each page of the application. When a page is active or selected, the corresponding emoji awakens, while the emojis representing other pages remain in a sleeping state.

For data storage, the project utilizes the local storage feature of the browser to store logged-in user details. Additionally, a JSON server is employed as the backend to store user details and post information, ensuring persistence and retrieval of data even after the application is closed or refreshed.
